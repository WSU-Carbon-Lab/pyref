## Pyref: The blazingly fast X-ray analysis toolkit

Pyref is a X-ray analysis toolkit based on the software libraries [pypxr](https://github.com/usnistgov/P-RSoXR),
[kkcalc](https://github.com/benajamin/kkcalc), and [refnx](https://github.com/refnx/refnx) implemented in rust,
and python, taking advantage of Polars. This toolkit provides the means to analyse X-ray experimental data
for the following experiments.

- X-ray Reflectivity: Tier 1
- X-ray Scattering: Tier 2
- X-ray Diffraction: Tier 3
