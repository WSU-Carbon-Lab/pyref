"""
Image processing module for Reflectance measurements on CCD Detectors.

This module provides a set of functions for processing images obtained from CCD
detectors, specifically for analyzing reflectance measurements. The goal is to deterct
the X-ray beam spot and use it to calculate the specular reflectance from a masked
image.
