"""
I/O Operations for Reflectivity Data at BL 11.0.1.2.

The goal of the I/O operations is to provide a simple interface for reading an
experiment from a file or series of files and ensuring that the data has the correct
format for analysis. This heavily relies on the pandas library for these operations and
these functions are designed to load data into a pandas DataFrame for analysis.
